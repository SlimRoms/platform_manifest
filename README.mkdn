Welcome to SlimRoms
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Slim8, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the Slim7 trees, use this command:


repo init -u git://github.com//Syn7ax3rror/platform_manifest.git -b or8.1	



Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync

Make a working directory, From your home folder run this command

$ mkdir -p ~/bin
$ mkdir -p ~/android/slimbean

Install the repository

$ curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo

Allow the repo to be executed

$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Change directories

$ cd android/slimbean/

Initialize the manifest

$ repo init -u https://github.com/SlimRoms/platform_manifest.git -b jb

Create a local manifest file with the following lines in your .repo folder

cd .repo/
gedit

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <manifest>

    <project name="Mattix724/android_device_samsung_d710" path="device/samsung/d710" revision="jellybean" remote="github" />
    <project name="Mattix724/android_hardware_samsung" path="hardware/samsung" revision="jellybean" remote="github" />
    <project name="Mattix724/proprietary_vendor_samsung" path="vendor/samsung/" revision="jellybean" remote="github" />

  </manifest>

save file as local_manifest.xml

Now sync the repositories

$ repo sync

This will take some time. Let it run, go watch a movie, hang out with friends, drink a few beers...

I will add more to this soon...
